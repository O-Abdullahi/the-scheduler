I'm very happy to share my first project with the world.

The Scheduler is a Tasks Management application running on Blockchain.

It is built for learning purposes. But it can be useful to busy individuals such as programmers, students, businessmen and women as it can helps stay organized and gives a structured plan to stick to

It is highly recommended to use test networks blockchain while using this app to avoid using real money(ether) while using the app.

The smart contract was written in solidity programming language.
For the scheduler-ui (frontend), React SDK as well as templates such as web3Button from thirdweb development framework were used. You can visit https://portal.thirdweb.com/react to learn more about thirdweb react SDK.
